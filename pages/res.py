            If the `mail_input` or `res_input` are empty, or if they contain random characters that do not form coherent text, do not generate a response. Instead, return the following message: "Please provide a valid email and response content."
            If the `mail_input` is empty, or if it contain random characters that do not form coherent text, do not generate a response. Instead, return the following message: "Please provide a valid email."
            If the `res_input` is empty, or if they contain random characters that do not form coherent text, do not generate a response. Instead, return the following message: "Please provide a valid response content."
            Otherwise, draft a professional email response to the above email. The response should:
            1. Address the sender politely and professionally based on the context of the received email.
            2. Include the "REQUIRED RESPONSE CONTENT" ({res_input}) as part of the body of the email in a natural and coherent way.
            3. Maintain a professional and formal tone throughout the email.
            4. Ensure clarity, grammatical accuracy, and proper formatting.

            Structure the email as follows:
            - **Subject**: A concise and relevant subject line for the response.
            - **Greeting**: Start with a professional salutation (e.g., "Dear [Name],").
            - **Body**: Incorporate the details from "REQUIRED RESPONSE CONTENT" while addressing the key points from the received email.
            - **Closing**: End with a polite closing statement and a professional sign-off.

            Generate only the final email text without any explanations or preambles.
